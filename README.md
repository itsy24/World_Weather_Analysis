## Project : Weather data and Vacation spot

### Program : Python, Jupyter Notebook

Overview: Weather data API used to determine various weather markers in specific cities/regions. Gathered data was plotted to determine correlation between latitude and a specific marker (ex. humidity). From that data set, locations were narrowed down using specific parameters for the weather perfect vacation inlcuding a possible hotel stay in.


Plotting latitude vs. temp/humidity/cloudiness/wind speed per the north and southern hemisphere showed:

A negative correlation is observed between latitude and temperature for the northern hemisphere. As latitude increases the max temperature decreases.
A positve correlation is observed between latitude and temperature for the southern hemisphere. As latitiude increases the max temeperature does as well.

A positive correlation between latitude and humidity is observed in both the northern and southern hemipsheres. So, as latitude increases so does the area's humidity.

A positive correlation between latitude and coudiness is observed in both the northern and southern hemipsheres. So, as latitude increases so does the area's cloudiness. However, the positve correlation is stronger in the southern hemisphere with an r-value of 0.39 vs the 0.13 r-value of the northern hemisphere.

A slight positve correlation (r-value = 0.16) is observed between latitude and wind speed for the northern hemisphere.
A negative correlation is observed between latitude and wind speed for the southern hemisphere. As latitiude increases the wind speed decreases.
